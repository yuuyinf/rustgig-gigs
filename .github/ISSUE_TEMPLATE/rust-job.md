__ORGANIZATION/COMPANY__: *[Organization (e.g. company) name; optionally link to your organization's website or careers page.]*

__TYPE__: *[Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]*

__LOCATION__: *[Where are your office or offices located? If your workplace language is not English-speaking, please specify it.]*

__REMOTE__: *[Do you offer the option of working remotely? Please state if you restrict remote work to certain regions or time zones, or if you expect or require availability within a certain time of day.]*

__VISA__: *[Does your organization sponsor visas?]*

__DESCRIPTION__: *[What does your organization do, and what are you using Rust for? How much experience are you seeking and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more relevant details for the job, the better.]*

__ESTIMATED COMPENSATION__: *[Provide at least a rough expectation of wages/salary, as a courteous behavior to your potential future colleagues.]*

__APPLICATION__: *[Ideally include e-mail address contact for the candidate to apply for the job, but you may also add other application mediums such as forms.]*

If you are listing multiple positions in the "Description" field above, then feel free to include this information inline above, and put "See above" in this field.

If compensation is negotiable, please attempt to provide at least a base estimate from which to begin negotiations. If compensation is highly variable, then feel free to provide a range.

If you expect compensation to be offset by other benefits, then include that information as well. If you do not have firm numbers, but do have relative expectations of candidate expertise (e.g. entry-level, senior), then you may include that. If you truly have no information, then put "Uncertain" here.

Note that some jurisdictions (e.g. United States' jurisdictions of California, Colorado, and New York City) require salary ranges on job postings. If your organization is in one of these locations or you plan to hire employees who reside in any of these locations, you are likely subject to these laws. Other jurisdictions may require salary information to be available upon request or that you provide it after the first interview. To avoid issues, we recommend all postings to provide salary information.

You must state in your posting if you are planning to compensate employees partially or fully in something other than fiat currency (e.g. cryptocurrency, stock options, equity, etc).

Do not put just "Uncertain" in this case as the default assumption is that the compensation will be 100% fiat.

[rustgig](https://github.com/rustgig) team will remove postings that fail to comply with this addendum. Thank you.]
