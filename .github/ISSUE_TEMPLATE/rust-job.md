__COMPANY__: [Company name; optionally link to your company's website or careers page.]

__TYPE__: [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]

__LOCATION__: [Where are your office or offices located? If your workplace language isn't English-speaking, please specify it.]

__REMOTE__: [Do you offer the option of working remotely? Please state clearly if remote work is restricted to certain regions or time zones, or if availability within a certain time of day is expected or required.]

VISA: [Does your company sponsor visas?]

DESCRIPTION: [What does your company do, and what are you using Rust for? How much experience are you seeking and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details the better.]

__ESTIMATED COMPENSATION__: [Be courteous to your potential future colleagues by attempting to provide at least a rough expectation of wages/salary.
If you are listing several positions in the "Description" field above, then feel free to include this information inline above, and put "See above" in this field.
If compensation is negotiable, please attempt to provide at least a base estimate from which to begin negotiations. If compensation is highly variable, then feel free to provide a range.
If compensation is expected to be offset by other benefits, then please include that information here as well. If you don't have firm numbers but do have relative expectations of candidate expertise (e.g. entry-level, senior), then you may include that here.
If you truly have no information, then put "Uncertain" here.
Note that some jurisdictions (e.g., California, Colorado, New York City) currently or will soon require salary ranges on job postings by law. If your company is based in one of these locations or you plan to hire employees who reside in any of these locations, you are likely subject to these laws. Other jurisdictions may require salary information to be available upon request or be provided after the first interview. To avoid issues, we recommend all postings provide salary information.
You must state clearly in your posting if you are planning to compensate employees partially or fully in something other than fiat currency (e.g. cryptocurrency, stock options, equity, etc).
Do not put just "Uncertain" in this case as the default assumption is that the compensation will be 100% fiat.
Postings that fail to comply with this addendum will be removed. Thank you.]
